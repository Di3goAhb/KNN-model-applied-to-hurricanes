This project analyzes the 'storms' dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christinezinkand/storms) to explore and understand tropical storms. Using data processing and cleaning techniques, i will refine the dataset to extract meaningful insights. The project will leverage Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in tropical storms that could contribute to a better understanding of their behavior
